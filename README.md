## Evan Purkhiser Configuration files

These are my personal configuration files for my desktop computer. They may be
used on other systems, but changes may need to be made.

### `.bashrc` and `.profile`

These files are stored in `~/.config/bash/bashrc` and `~/.config/bash/profile/*`
respectively, and should be symlinked into the home directory. There are multiple
`.profile`s that may be chosen.
